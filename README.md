## Description

Based on experiences and realities that occur in society, many cases are found related to the lack of teachers in several regions. This is an irony considering the high number of graduates with a Bachelor of Education degree (S. Pd) in Indonesia every year. Certainly, this is caused by several factors such as the lack of facilities and teacher allowances in certain regions, uneven distribution of graduates, and even the problem that fresh graduates do not understand the career path and how to start their teaching career. Information related to job vacancies for education graduates is usually spread by word of mouth from people closest to them. This will certainly be a problem because not everyone will have connections in the education field. Sanggoroe, a platform to search and provide information related to teaching job vacancies, can help students, fresh graduates, or anyone who wants to gain teaching experience by providing information related to teaching job vacancies. Users can post a job vacancy or search for a job vacancy. Therefore, by creating this application, we hope to help the government in efforts to improve the quality of education in all regions.
